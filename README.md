# port-folio

The first project in the Udacity - "Frontend Nano Degree"

    The project aim was to demonstrate the basic use of HTML5 and CSS3 conventions, using a development framework
    (where i chose to use the bootstrap framework), and apply basic responsive features in the page display. 
    
    The project exceeded expectation in 3 out of 4 categories.
